# Welcome To THE FEATURE ENGINEERING SERIES 
## Hacking The Data Science Pipeline!

We have state-of-the-art advanced algorithms to generate utterly fascinating visualizations, reveal billion dollar consumer purchasing patterns, and analyse revenue streams with big data coupled with jaw-dropping scalable analytics engines. But being a data scientist, it all all boils to a single point of entry especially when stepping out into industry— “Where Do I Start a Data Science Project?”

I have created this repo to rovide a complete walk through the early stages of the feature engineering pipeline through hands-on experience of a real world dataset of a recently held hackathon on [Kaggle - WiDS Datathon 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/c/widsdatathon2020).
 
### There are couple of reasons for choosing this dataset as a valulable project of Feature Engineering:
* This is **not a toy dataset to test performance of ML algorithms**. Infact, it is a real world dataset and **it does require effective feature engineering process to train a good performance ML model.**
* Has **tons of missing rows and plenty of data issues** that you will similarly encounter in your day to day data science projects.
* After the complete work-through, **you will start appreciating the value of feature engineering and why its worth spending time playing with your dataset.**

### The Kaggle Competition Challenge
The challenge is to create a model that uses data from the first 24 hours of intensive care to predict patient survival. MIT’s GOSSIS community initiative, with privacy certification from the Harvard Privacy Lab, has provided a dataset of more than 130,000 hospital Intensive Care Unit (ICU) visits from patients, spanning a one-year timeframe.
